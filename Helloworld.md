## This is a markdown file.

Steps I took to bring this file into my Remote Repository from my Local:

1. Made sure I had a Remote Repository set up. Then I cloned that onto my laptop using git clone "urltotherepo"

2. Then, made this file and then:
  git add -a
  git commit -m "message" where message is a message about changes made. So far, only been committed to Local still.
  git push : pushes the new contents of repo onto Remote Repo!
