## This is a markdown file.

Steps I took to bring this file into my Remote Repository from my Local:

1. Made sure I had a Remote Repository set up. Then I cloned that onto my laptop using git clone "urltotherepo"

2. Then, made this file and then:
  git add -a
  git commit -m "message" where message is a message about changes made. So far, only been committed to Local still.
  git push : pushes the new contents of repo onto Remote Repo!

  **One point to make is: instead of git push, you can use git push origin master when pushing from local to repo if you have multiple branches and want it to go to master (not the one you set as default).
